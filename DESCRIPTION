Title: Bayesian Mixture Survival Models using Additive
        Mixture-of-Weibull Hazards, with Lasso Shrinkage and
        Stratification
Version: 0.9.3
Date: 2025-01-08
Description: Bayesian Mixture Survival Models using Additive Mixture-of-Weibull Hazards, with Lasso Shrinkage and
        Stratification. As a Bayesian dynamic survival model, it relaxes the proportional-hazard assumption. Lasso shrinkage controls
        overfitting, given the increase in the number of free parameters in the model due to presence of two Weibull components
        in the hazard function.
